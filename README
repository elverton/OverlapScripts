- First, run 'process_all.py' to process the data from database dir. It will give
  the intersection files
- Second, run 'get_overlap_changes.sh' to get the diff between overlaps and
  generate the file intersectionpp files
- Third, run the 'evaluation.sh' to get the evaluation files.

Some explanations:
- scripts/database/overlap: all detections that meet the requirements of being a
  "healthy" detection
- scripts/database/paths: all paths that meet the requirements of being a
  "healthy" path
- scripts/database/changes: The same of overlap but with the pathdiff between
  old and new paths
- scripts/database/destinations: The destinations used
- ../process/intersections: All routes passing through detections. Discart
  detections that do not have intersections
